# Elden Ring: A Visual Guide To The Lands Between
This repository hosts the cleaned datasets and a public link to the interactive Tableau dashboard titled "Elden Ring: A Visual Guide to the Lands Between." 

As a fan of Souls games, I wanted to make the data more accessible for new players and create a welcoming introduction to Elden Ring. The dashboard is designed to provide clear insights into Elden Ring gameplay statistics and showcase why Elden Ring is one of the best games ever!
